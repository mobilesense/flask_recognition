This folder contains the base functions used in bigimbaz. 


Library files
=============

* vector.{h,c} and matrix.{h,c}

base functions for vector and matrix handling, including I/O 
in .fvecs and .ivecs file formats. 

* nn.{h,c}

Finding nearest neighbours in descriptor space. The functions are
mostly exact, but there is also an approximate nearest neighbour
searching structure. nn_cuda is a GPU version of the functions.

* clustering.{h,c}

K-means clustering.

* hkm.{h,c}

Hierarchical clustering.

* generic_hash_table.{h,c}

Hash table (not so unexpected)

* sorting.{h,c}

sort and find nearest neigbors, medians, ranks

* fast_alloc.{h,c}

create a memory structure to reduce the overhead of calling a malloc


Python interface & utilities
============================

* utils.swg, common.swg

Generates a python interface for the C-functions in the library. 
The import should be performed on common.swg (not utils.swg).
