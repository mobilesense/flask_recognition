What is it?
===========

This is a translation to C of PhotoMole, optimized for searches in a
small db. It is a filter because it is supposed to filter a short list
returned by bigimbaz.

=====

The main code and API is in filter_shortlist.{c,h}

There is a python interface generated by geom_filter.swg

dense.[ch] are a few functions that work on images. One day, they
shoud be extended to give a dense matching score. They depend on Lava.

How to compile?
===============

geom_filter's Makefile uses the following environment variables (set
via ../makefile.inc): 


USELAVA : if yes, the following should be set
LAVA2DIR : Lava2 includes are in $LAVA2DIR/include 
LAVA2LIB : the Lava2 library is $LAVA2LIB/liblava2.a

For 64-bit linux, you can set the variables with my install dirs:

source /scratch/cornwall/douze/release/setvars.bash

If USELAVA is not yes, the dense functions will not work.
